# SQL Challenge

## Scenario

As a newly hired data engineer at a fictional company, my first task is to research employees that worked with the company in the 80s and 90s. All that remains of the employee database from that time period are six CSV files. 

I will design tables to hold the data from the CSV files (data modeling), import the CSV files into a SQL database (data engineering), and then answer questions about the data (data analysis).

This project was completed as a part of the UTSA Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp.
